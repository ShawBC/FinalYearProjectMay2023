# Final Year Project

1. 09/02 -> Started introduction to Pytorch and Transfer Learning & using Transfer Learning with external datasets
2. 15/02 -> Downloaded a dataset called "IDMT-SMT-CHORDS", currently I am exploring the data and understanding how I can label it and pre-process it for YAMNet. In addition, I have found a google article on how to use YAMNet for a simple mobile app that I think will be very useful for later. https://developers.google.com/codelabs/tflite-audio-classification-custom-model-android
