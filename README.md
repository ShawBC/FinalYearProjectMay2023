Diary : In Report, located in heading "Diary Log"

Structure : Project files locatesd in two folders; YAMNet and VGG16 ; Base folder contains 2 csv files which are required by all programs. 
            The rest of the folders are data that I've used to either test or create scripts and can be ignored.
